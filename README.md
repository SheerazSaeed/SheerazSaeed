About Me:
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sheeraz. I've been on an exciting coding journey with The Odin Project for about 8 months now, currently diving deep into the intermediate course. I'm passionate about web development and love to create projects that challenge and inspire me.

Projects:
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

Dashboard: A dynamic dashboard for managing tasks or data.
Restaurant Page: A website replicating a restaurant's menu and information.
Amazon Replication: A project mimicking the layout and functionality of Amazon's interface.
Tic Tac Toe Game: A classic game implemented in a web environment.
Rock Paper Scissors: An interactive game where you can play against the computer.
Sign Up Form: A form for user registration, validation, and submission.
...and many more!
